Hi there! I am a **final-year Ph.D. candidate** in the Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech. I am working on integrating multimodal data, including knowledge graphs, images, and textual information, into machine learning models, particularly Vision Language Models, to enhance their applicability in scientific domains.

Under the supervision of [Prof. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/) in [KGML lab](https://kgml-lab.github.io/), my work extends to the development of Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning approaches for graph representation learning, GANs, segmentation, and imageomics, with a commitment to drive forward the convergence of Computer Vision, Graph Neural Networks, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing in scientific research.

I've also gathered experience in industry as a *research intern at Amazon (2022) and Qualcomm (2021)*. In 2023, I was awarded the [Kafura Graduate Fellowship](https://cs.vt.edu/Graduate/Funding/fellowships.html) from the Computer Science department at Virginia Tech.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my Master’s at [CS@VT](https://cs.vt.edu/). Previously, I had completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/). Apart from academia, I love reading books, playing Chess and Table tennis.

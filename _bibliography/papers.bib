  abstract={Images are increasingly becoming the currency for documenting biodiversity on the planet, providing novel opportunities for accelerating scientific discoveries in the field of organismal biology, especially with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). We ask if pre-trained VLMs can aid scientists in answering a range of biologically relevant questions without any additional fine-tuning. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs in the field of organismal biology using a novel dataset, VLM4Bio, consisting of 469K question-answer pairs involving 30K images from three groups of organisms: fishes, birds, and butterflies, covering five biologically relevant tasks. We also explore the effects of applying prompting techniques and tests for reasoning hallucination on the performance of VLMs, shedding new light on the capabilities of current SOTA VLMs in answering biologically relevant questions using images.},

  abstract={A grand challenge in biology is to discover evolutionary traitsâ€”features of organisms common to a group of species with a shared ancestor in the tree of life (also referred to as phylogenetic tree). With the growing availability of image repositories in biology, there is a tremendous opportunity to discover evolutionary traits directly from images in the form of a hierarchy of prototypes. However, current prototype-based methods are mostly designed to operate over a flat structure of classes and face several challenges in discovering hierarchical prototypes, including the issue of learning over-specific features at internal nodes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the framework of Hierarchy aligned Commonality through Prototypical Networks (HComP-Net). We empirically show that HComP-Net learns prototypes that are accurate, semantically consistent, and generalizable to unseen species in comparison to baselines on birds, butterflies, and fish datasets.},

  abstract = {A central problem in evolutionary biology is to explore the genetic basis of evolutionary changes in the traits of organisms, such as fin structures in fish or beak colors in birds. With the growing availability of large-scale image repositories in biology and recent advances in generative modeling, there is an opportunity to study changes in evolutionary traits of species automatically from images. We introduce a novel Hierarchical Embedding (HIER-Embed) strategy to encode the evolutionary information of a species as a composition of encodings learned at every internal node in the phylogenetic tree. We use HIER-Embeddings to condition latent diffusion models to generate synthetic images of species. Further, we introduce two novel types of perturbation operations: trait masking and trait swapping, similar in spirit to gene knockout experiments, that enable us to analyze novel changes in evolutionary traits acquired at different levels of phylogeny.},
